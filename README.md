The Dashboard displays the Top 10 brokers and data visualisation through a Pie Chart and a 'Business Class Premiums Data'. It also comes with a chatbot.
The chatbot is built using 'FAISS'(Facebook AI Similarity Score) to create a knowledge base using the Excel Sheets data, which is then chained to the LLM using LangChain. The LLM uses a gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 model with hugging faceÂ embeddings.

The project was made in collaboration with [Akshat Srivastava](https://github.com/Kazekage19) who helped me with the design and formatting of the dashboard.
